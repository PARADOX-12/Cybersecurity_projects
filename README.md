## üîß How It Works

### **1. Initialization & Configuration**
- Configures professional logging with timestamps
- Sets up enhanced session management with custom headers
- Initializes rate limiting and multi-threading parameters
- Prepares vulnerability tracking and reporting systems

### **2. Web Crawling Phase**
- Starts recursive crawling from target URL
- Discovers internal pages up to specified depth (default: 3)
- Maintains visited URL tracking to prevent infinite loops
- Normalizes URLs to avoid duplicate scanning

### **3. Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing**

**üî¥ SQL Injection Detection:**
- Tests multiple SQL injection payloads: `'`, `1' OR '1'='1'`, `' OR 1=1--`, `' UNION SELECT NULL--`
- Analyzes responses for database error messages (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle)
- Identifies vulnerable parameters in GET requests

**üü† Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing:**
- Injects various XSS payloads including script tags and event handlers
- Tests reflection of malicious scripts in application responses
- Checks for successful payload execution indicators

**üü° CSRF Vulnerability Analysis:**
- Examines all forms for state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Identifies missing CSRF protection tokens
- Analyzes form structure and security implementations

**üü¢ Directory Traversal Testing:**
- Tests path traversal payloads: `../../../etc/passwd`, Windows paths, encoded variants
- Looks for successful file system access indicators
- Checks multiple encoding and bypass techniques

**üîµ Open Redirect Detection:**
- Tests common redirect parameters: `url`, `redirect`, `next`, `return`, `goto`, `continue`
- Injects malicious redirect URLs and analyzes HTTP redirect responses
- Identifies unvalidated redirect vulnerabilities

**üü£ Security Headers Assessment:**
- Verifies presence of critical security headers:
  - `X-Frame-Options` (Clickjacking protection)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options` (MIME sniffing protection)
  - `X-XSS-Protection` (XSS protection header)
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS enforcement)
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP protection)
  - `Referrer-Policy` (Referrer policy)

**‚ö´ Session Security Analysis:**
- Examines cookies for security flags:
  - `Secure` flag for HTTPS-only transmission
  - `HttpOnly` flag to prevent XSS cookie access
  - `SameSite` attribute for CSRF protection

**üî∂ Sensitive Information Detection:**
- Pattern-based detection using regex:
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers (US format)
  - Social Security Numbers
  - API keys and tokens

### **4. Advanced Reporting System**
- Generates unique signatures to prevent duplicate vulnerability reporting
- Provides detailed evidence including URLs, parameters, and successful payloads
- Color-coded console output for immediate threat identification
- Comprehensive scan statistics and summary
